      "\"What is in the stars is on earth and what is on earth is in the stars.\"<br/>This idea unites the ceremonial map in the circle of stars, not only with sites in the Black Hills, but with a round of ceremonial actions at sacred sites there, ending with a Sun Dance at the Bear's Lodge (Devil's Tower) June 21 (summer solstice). \"As above, so below\" that is, what occurs in the stars is mirrored on earth is a very old idea now forgotten by Western culture. It is expressed in Alchemy and the even older idea that humankind and our events are a microcosmic mirror of the macrocosm."
